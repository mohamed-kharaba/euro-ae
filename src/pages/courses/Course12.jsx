            <h5>Introduction:</h5>

            <p>
                As technological systems become more complex, it becomes
                increasingly difficult to identify safety hazards and to control
                their impact. Plant Managers and Engineers are becoming more
                aware that safety and risk touch on every aspect of the
                day-to-day running of their Plants and engineering and process
                systems if they are to comply with ever-changing and demanding
                International, and National environmental and economic values
                and standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unsafe systems can result in monies being lost due to accidents,
                disruption to production, criminal and civil prosecutions, loss
                of market share, and the degradation of company assets and the
                environment.
            </p>

            <h5>TRAINING METHODOLOGY:</h5>

            <p>
                This Safety Technology & Risk Management Styles course consists
                of five modules containing lecture content, skill assessments,
                participative discussions, video presentations, and delegate
                exercises to create high-impact training. This Safety Technology
                & Risk Management course is designed to be dynamic and highly
                interactive as well as educational. The primary focus is to
                provide delegates with concepts and methods that they can put to
                immediate use in the workplace.
