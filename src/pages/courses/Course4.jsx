            <h5>INTRODUCTION:</h5>

            <p>
                Safety is not the prerogative of the safety specialist but also
                one of the parts of every management discipline. An office
                manager is no less responsible for the safety of his team than
                the construction manager. The law and company policy apply
                equally to both. The course will not turn delegates into safety
                experts, but it will give them an appreciation of what safety
                issues are about and the methods available to them to ensure
                that safety is implemented in their workplaces. It is, after
                all, a managerâ€™s responsibility to have a workplace free of
                danger and a workforce free of ill health and accidents.
                Managers will be able to review their departmental systems for
                safety, introducing new controls or implementing changes as
                appropriate to ensure safety in the workplace.
            </p>
