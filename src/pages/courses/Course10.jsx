            <h5>Introduction:</h5>

            <p>
                Performance Management is ensuring that the employee and the
                organization are focused and aligned towards strategic
                priorities. This Performance Management online training course
                through Euro Training Center will show you how to integrate
                Performance Objectives, Critical Success Factors, and Key
                Performance Indicators into a performance management system
                applied by a highly skilled leadership, managerial, and
                supervisory team.
            </p>
            <p>
                This will enable the top-performing companies to not only
                develop future and existing leaders but also formulate robust
                performance management processes. This includes regular
                performance reviews and detailed appraisals, merit-based reward
                and recognition, staff development aligned with business needs,
                and defensible approaches to low or non-performance. Managers
                need to customize their strategies to each staff, whether
                developing stretched goals for over-performers or dealing with
                difficult and or low-performing staff. The correct design and
                usage of SMART objectives also enable requisite to follow
                through and play an integral part in any performance management
                system.
